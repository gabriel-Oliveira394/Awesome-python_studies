    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **object-oriented programming language**. Object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on creating reusable patterns of code, in contrast to **procedural programming**, which focuses on explicit sequenced instructions. When working on complex programs in particular, object-oriented programming lets you reuse code and write code that is more readable, which in turn makes it more maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming is the distinction between classes and objects, which are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class** — A blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Object** — An instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is manifested in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are used to create patterns (in the case of classes) and then make use of the patterns (in the case of objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll go through **creating classes, instantiating objects, initializing attributes** with the constructor method, and working with more than one object of the same class."
