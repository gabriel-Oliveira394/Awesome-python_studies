    "# Introduction\n",
    "Object-oriented programming allows for variables to be used at the class level or the instance level. **Variables** are essentially symbols that stand in for a value you’re using in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the class level, variables are referred to as **class variables**, whereas variables at the instance level are called **instance variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we expect variables are going to be consistent across instances, or when we would like to initialize a variable, we can define that variable at the class level. When we anticipate the variables will change significantly across instances, we can define them at the instance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the principles of software development is the **DRY** principle, which stands for **don’t repeat yourself**. This principle is geared towards limiting repetition within code, and object-oriented programming adheres to the DRY principle as it reduces redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will demonstrate the use of both **class and instance variables** in object-oriented programming within Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "You should have Python 3 installed and a programming environment set up on your computer or server. If you don’t have a programming environment set up, you can refer to the installation and setup guides for a local programming environment or for a programming environment on your server appropriate for your operating system (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class Variables\n",
    "Class variables are defined within the class construction. Because they are owned by the class itself, class variables are shared by all instances of the class. They therefore will generally have the same value for every instance unless you are using the class variable to initialize a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined outside of all the methods, class variables are, by convention, typically placed right below the class header and before the constructor method and other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class variable alone looks like the following:\n",
