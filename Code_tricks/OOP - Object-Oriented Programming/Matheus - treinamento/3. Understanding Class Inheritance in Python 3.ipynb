    "# Introduction\n",
    "Object-oriented programming creates reusable patterns of code to curtail redundancy in development projects. One way that object-oriented programming achieves recyclable code is through inheritance, when one subclass can leverage code from another base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will go through some of the major aspects of inheritance in Python, including how parent classes and child classes work, how to override methods and attributes, how to use the ```super()``` function, and how to make use of multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "You should have Python 3 installed and a programming environment set up on your computer or server. If you don’t have a programming environment set up, you can refer to the installation and setup guides for a local programming environment or for a programming environment on your server appropriate for your operating system (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# What Is Inheritance?\n",
    "**Inheritance** is when a class uses code constructed within another class. If we think of inheritance in terms of biology, we can think of a child inheriting certain traits from their parent. That is, a child can inherit a parent’s height or eye color. Children also may share the same last name with their parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes called **child classes** or **subclasses** inherit methods and variables from **parent classes** or **base classes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of a parent class called ```Parent``` that has class variables for ```last_name```, ```height```, and ```eye_color``` that the child class ```Child``` will inherit from the ```Parent```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the ```Child``` subclass is inheriting from the ```Parent``` base class, the ```Child``` class can reuse the code of ```Parent```, allowing the programmer to use fewer lines of code and decrease redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parent Classes\n",
    "Parent or base classes create a pattern out of which child or subclasses can be based on. Parent classes allow us to create child classes through inheritance without having to write the same code over again each time. Any class can be made into a parent class, so they are each fully functional classes in their own right, rather than just templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have a general ```Bank_account``` parent class that has ```Personal_account``` and ```Business_account``` child classes. Many of the methods between personal and business accounts will be similar, such as methods to withdraw and deposit money, so those can belong to the parent class of ```Bank_account```. The ```Business_account``` subclass would have methods specific to it, including perhaps a way to collect business records and forms, as well as an ```employee_identification_number``` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, an ```Animal``` class may have ```eating()``` and ```sleeping()``` methods, and a ```Snake``` subclass may include its own specific ```hissing()``` and ```slithering()``` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create a ```Fish``` parent class that we will later use to construct types of fish as its subclasses. Each of these fish will have first names and last names in addition to characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Info: To follow along with the example code in this tutorial, open a Python interactive shell on your local system by running the python3 command. Then you can copy, paste, or edit the examples by adding them after the >>> prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll create a new file called ```fish.py``` and start with the ```__init__()``` constructor method, which we’ll populate with ```first_name``` and ```last_name``` class variables for each ```Fish``` object or subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have initialized our ```last_name``` variable with the string ```\"Fish\"``` because we know that most fish will have this as their last name."

    "Inheritance in object-oriented coding can allow for adherence to the DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principle of software development, allowing for more to be done with less code and repetition. Inheritance also compels programmers to think about how they are designing the programs they are creating to ensure that code is effective and clear. "
